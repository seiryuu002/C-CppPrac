 *         INHERITANCE and its TYPES.
 *
 * Inheritance - In C++, inheritance is a process in which one object
 * acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object
 * automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the
 * attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class.
 *
 * In C++, the class which inherits the members of another class is 
 * called derived class and the class whose members are inherited is 
 * called base class. The derived class is the specialized class for 
 * the base class.
