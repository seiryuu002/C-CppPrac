// STL Introduction(standard template library)
/* It provides implementaation of basic data structures so that
 we don't need to implement whole data structure from scratch 
 STL in Cpp can be divided into two parts 1.Containers 2.Algorithms*/
// Containers -> it is implementation of basic data structures
/* Containers can be further divide into three types of containers
    1.Simple ->            pair, vector, forward_list, list
    2.Container adapters-> stack, queue, priority_queue
    3.Associative ->       set, map, unordered_set, unordered_map*/
// Algorithms -> are implementation of basic algorithms.
// ex. -> binary_search, find, reverse, sort, etc.
